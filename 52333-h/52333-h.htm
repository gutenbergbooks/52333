<b><big>MUSICAL SKETCHES FOR YOUNG LADIES</big></b><br />
<b>By Harry C. Eldridge</b><br />
</div>

<p>These fill an urgent need in supplying
musical numbers with action, for any secular
program, for girls or ladies of any age. Clever
words and singable music combined to make
novel numbers for your entertainment.</p>

<p><b>THE HAT OF OTHER DAYS.</b> Everyone knows how
ridiculous the changing styles make out-of-date
hats appear. The song is based on this
fact, and the appearance of these “hats of
other days” will cause loads of merriment.</p>

<p>“<b>I CAN’T DO A THING WITH MY HAIR SINCE IT’S WASHED.</b>”
Did you ever hear the above expression? They
all say it. This song is for a merry group of
girls who have trouble in keeping their hair in
bounds. A jolly song.</p>

<p><b>REDUCED TO $1.99.</b> The figures in a dry goods
show window are indignant at having to participate
in so many “reduction sales,” and,
revolting, walk off the stage after telling
their troubles in song. The eccentric motions
of these figures make a very laughable number.</p>

<p><b>THE WINNING WAYS OF GRANDMA’S DAYS.</b> Sung in
costume, this portrays the many welcome and
pleasing costumes of “ye olden times.” Directions
for minuet included. Very enjoyable.</p>

<h2>SCENE.</h2>


<p>The scenery is the same for both acts. If given
out doors select if possible a place among trees or
large bushes. One tent will be sufficient to represent
the camp, and only a portion of this need be visible.
A hammock with bright colored cushions will add to
the effect. Have one or two camp stools, a sketching
outfit, and a Kodak near the tent.</p>

<p>If the play is given indoors small trees or leafy
branches placed in buckets of sand may be used to
represent the woods. Cover the floor with brown
denim or linen, and scatter leaves, pineneedles and
cones upon it.</p>

<p>The campers wear middy blouses with short dark
skirts or bloomers. Miss Morgan’s costume is similar
except that her skirt is longer.</p>

<p>Lucille and Miss Pickett wear any costume appropriate
for motoring and the latter carries a
lorgnette.</p>

<p>Lucille, her niece.</p>


<h3>Suggestions.</h3>

<p>The character of Miss Pickett offers great opportunity
for comedy, as much of the success of the play
will depend upon her ability to be serious, yet funny.
Her efforts to keep up with the girls in their drills
and exercises, her ludicrous appearance in the misfit
costume in the second scene should make a hit. A
little musical program interpolated at any point or
points the director sees fit will add to the enjoyment
and lengthen the play. “I Can’t Do a Thing With
My Hair Since It’s Washed,” an action song for
young ladies, price 25 cents, will fit admirably in this
play.</p>

<p>Drills may be introduced in the second act if desired,
a bow and arrow drill, or dumb bell drill being
especially appropriate.</p>

<p>A brief program of songs and recitations may
also be included in the second act.</p>

<h2>SCENE I.</h2>

<p><i>As the curtain rises girls are seen seated, Hilda
embroidering, Ruth busy with raffia, Hope making a
basket. Enter Kitty.</i></p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Look at the industry on a warm morning.
I’ll be the sluggard. (<i>Seats herself in the hammock
and opens a book.</i>) How’s the fancy work, Hilda?</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> I wish the old thing was done. Carolyn
sails next week and I want this traveling case to be
finished in time.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> I wish I were going on a nice trip like
Carolyn.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Uncle Fred went to Europe last summer,
and he said he was simply tired of the everlasting
tipping. Finally he saw a sign in his room at the
hotel, “Please tip the basin after using,” and he said
he drew the line there.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> I’d love the ocean voyage, and I know I
wouldn’t be afraid, even in a storm. Mother told me
that when she went over, there was an old lady who
was terribly nervous, and each day she pestered the
captain, asking him how far it was to land. Finally
one day he answered her politely, “Five miles, madam.”
She was delighted and asked very eagerly
“where?” and he told her “straight down below our
keel, madam.”</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Uncle Fred wasn’t a bit seasick, but one
day on deck a man and his wife were near him, all
bundled up in their steamer chairs and looking terribly
woebegone. Their little boy was playing around
full of mischief, and the mother said feebly, “Papa,
won’t you speak to Willie?” And papa said just as
feebly, “How do you do, Willie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Well, I don’t like troublesome children. I
had to take care of Cousin Julia’s baby all one afternoon
and he did nothing but cry. So I let him cry into
the phonograph, so that when he grew up he could
hear what a troublesome baby he had been.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> I ought to be studying, seeing as I flunked
in history this June.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> I don’t believe you know a thing about
history, Kit.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Yes, I do. I know that when the great
patriot, Nathan Hale, was about to be executed he
said, “Would that I were a cat that I might have
nine lives to give to my country.”</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> Where’s Betty?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Gone for the mail.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Miss Morgan with her?</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> No, Miss Morgan went down to the lake
to sketch.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> I wish I were an artist. I tried to paint
a sunset once, but the family thought it was a tomato
omelet, so I forebore.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Betty’s taking her time with the mail.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> I gave her five cents for lollypops.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> I gave her ten. What’s camp without
lollypops?</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Distant call is heard “Wohelo.”</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><i>Girls.</i> (<i>reply</i>) Wohelo.</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Enter Miss Morgan with sketching outfit.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Did I hear Betty call?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Yes, she’s just coming up the path.</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Enter Betty with mail bag slung over her shoulder.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> (<i>Wiping her forehead.</i>) Whew, it’s a
warm day.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> (<i>Reaching for mail bag.</i>) Here, hand over
the letters like a nice lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Girls crowd around Betty.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> (<i>waving them back.</i>) Stand back, ladies,
and show some respect for the representative of the
postal system of our nation. <i>I’ll</i> distribute the mail.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> I hope I got a letter.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> You don’t deserve one for you only write
postals.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> I only wrote two last week.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> (<i>distributing mail</i>) Miss Hope Harwood.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> Oh, that’s from mother.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Miss Morgan, two letters and a paper.</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Thank you, Betty.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> What an example! Miss Morgan is the
only one who has thanked me for bringing her letters
up a steep mountain path beset by tiger lillies, dandelions,
foxglove, wolfsbane and every flower
carrying a pistil.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Go on and pass out the mail.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Miss Kitty Carroll, Miss Ruth Scott.
That’s all but the lollypops and here they are.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> Did you get my stamps?</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Oh no, I forgot them.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> You said you’d surely remember and you
tied a knot in your handkerchief.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Well it was a forget-me-knot that time.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Oh, isn’t this a pity? Lucille can’t come.
Her aunt’s going to take her on a motor trip.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Motor trip? I should think that would
be lovely.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Not a motor trip a la Aunt Jane. Aunt
Camilla and Uncle Samuel will go along. Lucille and
the two aunts will sit squeezed together on the back
seat, and the conversation will be exclusively devoted
to nervous dyspepsia and sciatica. When Uncle Samuel
can get a word in edgewise he will pipe up about
the wholesale price of lard and pork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Lovely prospect for Lucille.</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Girls, I have good news for you. I
have a letter from Miss Pickett, Lucille’s Aunt Jane,
and she writes that she has decided to surprise Lucille.
They will stop here and visit us for a day on
their way to join Mr. and Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> That’s Uncle Samuel and Aunt Camilla
of pork and lard fame.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Hooray, girls!</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> She sent me a special delivery
letter which for some reason was not delivered last
night.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> The postmaster told me he was already to
go to lodge, so he thought the letter could wait till
morning.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> He was as bad as the telegraph operator
at Birchwood last summer. Uncle’s partner sent him
a code message, and the operator never delivered it.
He said “It didn’t make no sense so he didn’t see no
use of walking two miles with it.”</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> When is Lucille coming, Miss Morgan?</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> The fourteenth—why that’s today.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Dear me, girls, we must hurry and get
this place fixed up.</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Are your tents in order? They
were at inspection this morning but they’ve had time
to get disarranged.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Mine is spick and span. I believe in a
place for everything and everything in its place.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> And that place is the tray of your trunk.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Well, what’s the objection to that? When
I want a ribbon or a belt I simply stir up a bit like
this (<i>gesture</i>) till it comes to the surface.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Aunt Jane is horribly tidy and terribly
particular.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> You’re right there. She took the dust
out of industrious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Better pick up those few papers,
girls.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> Sure. Let’s lay out some plain sewing
and a few improving books, so as to give a good impression.</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Sound of motor horn.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Oh, there’s the car, come on girls and
meet them.</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Exit girls;</i>)<br />
</p>

<p>(<i>Miss Morgan glances in tent, straightens pillows
in hammock, and puts away her sketching outfit.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> I do hope that we can impress
Miss Pickett favorably so that she will allow Lucille
to stay with us, but that is a little too much to expect.
Poor child, I believe her aunt would like to send her
to an old-fashioned boarding school, if she could find
one, and have her taught to make alum baskets and
play the Maiden’s Prayer.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter Miss Pickett, Lucille and campers.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> This is a terrible hill. It will give
me nervous dyspepsia or sciatica or both.</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Miss Pickett, we are delighted to
see you at our camp.... (<i>Kisses Lucille</i>) Lucille, dear,
this is lovely.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Isn’t this great to have Lucille here?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> (<i>politely</i>) And Miss Pickett.</p>

<p>(<i>Girls assist Miss Pickett and Lucille to remove
their wraps.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Did you have a pleasant trip?</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> It was quite tiresome for we lost
our way. All the guide posts told us to use Scrubit
Soap or Purple Pills for Pale People. Then for the last
half hour when they did condescend to mention Pineville,
it was always the same distance. First it was
eight miles to Pineville, then after riding ten minutes
it was eight miles to Pineville, and then after fifteen
minutes it was still eight miles to Pineville. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
chauffeur was quite impertinent, for he said, “Thank
goodness, we are holding our own anyway.”</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> How very annoying.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Well, Lucille was so set on coming
that I decided to let her have a day of it. Though
for the life of me I can’t see the fun of having spiders
crawl over you while you sleep, and ants in the coffee,
and eating canned stuff for weeks. I will say frankly
it is not my idea of a ladylike vacation.</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> We certainly appreciate your
kindness in bringing Lucille when it caused you so
much inconvenience.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Miss Pickett may I lend Lucille a middy
blouse and skirt for the day?</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Well, to tell the truth I never approved
of that costume. The middies, as you call
them, remind me of the way the Chinese laundrymen
wear their clothes. I like a dress neatly belted in.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> But Lucille might spoil her suit.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> It is such a stylish suit. Did you have it
made in New York?</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> (<i>pleased</i>) No, the dressmaker
made it under my supervision. Very well, Lucille,
you may accept Betty’s offer.</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Miss Pickett suppose you and I
go down to the lake where it is cooler.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh, that will be lovely, Miss Morgan,
take her out in the canoe.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> No indeed. My nephew Robert
has one, and on one occasion he wished to have a discussion
with his father. My brother Jonas is quick
tempered and will never listen to argument so Robert
invited him out in his canoe, and when he had Jonas
out in the middle of the river he opened up the subject.
Poor Jonas didn’t dare to walk up and down
the way he usually does, but he had to sit still and
listen calmly for Robert warned him that the canoe
would upset at the slightest motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> It was very diplomatic of Robert.</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> We can sit by the lake and enjoy
the breezes.</p>

<p><i>Lucille.</i> And hear the very latest in the line of
dyspepsia and sciatica.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Well Lucille, you may accept Betty’s
kind offer of a middy blouse and skirt. Hang
your coat carefully on a hanger and don’t fall into
the lake whatever you do.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> (<i>softly</i>) Hang your clothes on a hickory
limb but don’t go near the water.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Come on girls for we must crowd two
weeks’ fun into a single day.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh Ruth what do you suppose has happened?</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> Oh I couldn’t keep my face straight.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> It was perfectly awful.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> I was scared.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Scared nothing. The water was only a
foot deep.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Well won’t you tell a person what’s happened?</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Mercy Ruth didn’t you hear the screams
yourself?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Where were your ears?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> (<i>irritated</i>) You girls make me tired.
Can’t you tell me what happened?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Hope you tell.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> Well Aunt Jane went down to the lake
with Miss Morgan as she said she would. Then she
took a notion to walk around it. That’s scene two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Scene three she saw a water lily near the edge that she
wanted, and she reached for it and slipped in. The
water was only a foot deep but of course she got
wringing wet. She set up a S. O. S. call or whatever
the latest wireless is and Betty and Lucille rushed to
the rescue. First aid to the injured you know.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Of course poor Aunt Jane was soaking
wet, and then the question was what to do?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Couldn’t you girls have gone to the village
to get dry clothing from her suit case?</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Nix. For she had let the chauffeur go to
Cherry Valley to see his mother.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> Aunt Jane wanted a blanket wrapper, for
of course Miss Morgan’s clothes wouldn’t fit her.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Just imagine how hilarious it would be
to see Aunty sitting around all day in a blanket wrapper
and worsted slippers.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> But Betty came to the rescue. She actually
coaxed Aunt Jane to accept the loan of a middy
blouse and skirt to wear for the rest of the day while
her clothes dried in the sun.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Miss Pickett in a middy blouse. Where’s
my Kodak?</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> Oh we’ve all got to behave ourselves I
can tell you, for if we don’t look out Miss Pickett will
get so soured on camps, she won’t let Lucille even
mention the word.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> I’ll tell you what we must do. Betty is
dressing auntie up in camp clothes, and we must do
our best to make her have a nice day, and convert
her to the joys of camping. She’s mad as a wet hen
now.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> Well we’ll all try our best to rejuvenate
her and give her a jolly day.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter Miss Morgan, Miss Pickett, Betty, Lucille.
Miss Pickett is dressed ridiculously in middy blouse,
too small for her and a short skirt.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Why Miss Pickett how nice you look!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Nice in this scandalous costume!
I’m glad that the Ladies Aid Society and the Civic
club can’t see me.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Now Aunt Jane—excuse me—but I wish
you’d let me call you that—believe me that red is becoming
to you, very. Isn’t it girls?</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> And the costume is comfortable
too.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Yes I admit that.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> I have a proposition to make, Aunt Jane.
Can’t I call you that, too?</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Why yes, you may if you wish.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Oh lovely! Well this is my idea. You be
a regular camper today, for we want you to see just
what jolly good times we have.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Mercy sakes, do you want me to
do high diving and walk ten miles, and eat fish blackened
over a wood fire?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Oh that isn’t camping. We lead the simple
life, not the strenuous one.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> I think it would be lovely for her to spend
a day just exactly as we spend it.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Go through the whole program you know.</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Well, somewhat modified.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Our first stunt is putting our tents in
order.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Stunt!</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> (<i>explaining</i>) Stunt means—well, a task,
an accomplishment.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Hope’s tent is the banner one. It’s all
plastered up with mottoes.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> I was going to fix up Hope’s bed pie-fashion
one time, and when I hesitated at the door, I saw
her motto “Do it now” so I did.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> I am sure I could pass an examination
in orderliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucille.</i> Aunt Jane is the most spick and span
housekeeper you ever saw.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Well we can put down credits for that
then.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> After tent inspection we have a wand
drill, to make us graceful. Let’s have that.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Oh girls you must excuse me from
that.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Come Aunt Jane, you’ll enjoy it.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> It’s just the thing for sciatica.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> And for nervous dyspepsia.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Well I suppose I might as well be—</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> A sport.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> I’ll get the wands and you lead us, Miss
Morgan.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Lucille, you come on too. It’s the same
drill we had at school.</p>

<p>(<i>Wand drill, in which Miss Pickett follows awkwardly
the motions of the girls.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> That is fine, you did splendidly. If you
did that every day you’d never have nervous dyspepsia.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Now while we rest we have half an hour
for mending.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Why, do you girls sew up here?</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Certainly they do. They keep
their clothing all in good repair.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> I quite approve of that.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> You should see us wash blouses too.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> We go down to the lake and pick out a
nice flat rock.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Then we soak our blouses awhile and then
scrub them on the rock with a nail brush.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> And hang them up to dry on the trees—that
old tree over there usually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> What a beautiful old oak. I wonder
what it would say if it could speak.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> (<i>quietly</i>) It would probably say “I am a
maple.”</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Now we’ll consider our mending time
done, and next is the swimming hour.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Never.</p>

<p><i>Lucille.</i> I’m crazy to learn to swim Aunt Jane.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Why if you can’t swim you miss half
your life and sometimes all of it.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> I was down at the swimming pool at
home one day and Mrs. Brent, she is terribly rich you
know brought down her little dog and told the man
she wanted her dog to learn to swim. So the man
took the doggie and tossed him into the pool and doggie
paddled back, of course. Then the man rubbed
him with a Turkish towel, and told Mrs. Brent that
was the first lesson and the charge was fifty cents
and to bring the dog twice a week for six weeks.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Let’s have the land practice Miss Morgan,
the way we did when we were learning.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Land practice?</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> The girls are taught the motions
of swimming before they go in the water.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Come on, Aunt Jane, this is good for
sciatica.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> And nervous dyspepsia.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Ready for practice girls, form in line.</p>

<p>(<i>Girls go through land practice in swimming. Miss
Pickett following awkwardly. This is a sort of gymnastic
exercise. Girls wave arms in unison as in swimming,
using the different strokes, lifting first one foot
and then the other, with occasional kicks. Miss Pickett’s
efforts to follow them can be made very funny.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Aunt Jane.</i> How unspeakably grotesque. I am
certainly glad that my neighbors and the members of
the Civic Club could not see me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucille.</i> I think it’s great. I know I could learn
to swim real soon.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> But just see how much better you feel.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Why you have a nice color in your face.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> And your hair is getting wavy all around
your face.</p>

<p><i>Lucille.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Half the morning gone and
Aunt Jane hasn’t mentioned nerves. What’s going to
happen?</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Now I think our guest had better
rest.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Why I was going to propose a hike. Let’s
take a tramp to Blueberry Hill?</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Dear me, do you have tramps
here?</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> No indeed, a walk, Betty means.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> A hike is the correct term. We pack up a
lunch and then go for a little stroll of ten miles.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> I believe in walking every day,
and each morning I walk three blocks to market.
The other morning a young bride was doing her buying,
and I heard her ask the butcher for an eighth of
lamb, as a quarter was too much.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Mother heard a woman complain to the
butcher that the lamb was a little spoiled and the
butcher said “No wonder ma’am that lamb was a
great pet of my children’s and I was afraid they’d
spoil it.”</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Well Aunt Jane, we can’t give you a
credit for hiking on the strength of three blocks to
the butchers’ but if you lived with us any length of
time we’d have you a champion.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> We aren’t always so strenuous, Miss
Pickett. We embroider.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> And we do basketry, see what I’m making
for mother.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> And we work with raffia, too. Isn’t this
a pretty bag?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> Your work is very creditable
indeed. My mother when she was a girl made alum
baskets and wax flowers, and wreaths from the hair
of relatives, but these are prettier.</p>

<p><i>Lucille.</i> That’s a compliment. Your basket is
prettier than the camelias made from Aunt Susan’s
back hair.</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> I think you girls are forgetting
the most important feature of all.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> (<i>counting on her fingers</i>) Hiking, swimming,
drill—</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Dinner!</p>

<p><i>Lucille.</i> I was hoping some one would mention
that.</p>

<p><i>Miss Morgan.</i> Ruth and Hope are the dinner
girls this week.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Well, we’ll try to do ourselves proud.
(<i>Exit with Hope.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> I confess I am hungry.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Ruth is our star cook.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> She is economical too. She can make an
omelet for ten people with two eggs and a bicycle
pump.</p>

<p><i>Lucille.</i> I smell lamb chops.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Yes the girls are broiling them in the
cornpopper.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> How resourceful.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> (<i>outside.</i>) Mercy there’s a spider on the
custard. Pick it out Ruth, I’m busy, for there are a
dozen ants in the sugar bowl.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> How dreadful.</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> (<i>outside.</i>) Oh my nice cream cake. A
toad jumped right in the middle of the meringue. I’ll
smooth it over, it will never show.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> How terrible.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Don’t worry, Aunt Jane, the girls are
only teasing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> (<i>outside.</i>) I guess we can serve now.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter Ruth and Hope in caps and aprons.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hope.</i> Dinner, ladies.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Aunt Jane, I heard your scoffing words
about the prevalence of ants at picnic tables, and I can
assure you that you will be the only aunt who graces
our festal board.</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Aunt Jane, you look lots better than
when you came this morning. Tell me honestly
haven’t you enjoyed it?</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> I believe you have given me a very
fair initiation into camp life.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> All but the hikes and watermelon picnics
and campfire stunts.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Well, those can be counted as a post
graduate course.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> I understand that camper Fire
girls not only stand for neatness—</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> Ruth, make a bow.</p>

<p>(<i>Ruth bows.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> —and orderliness—</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Like mending our clothes,</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> —and courage.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> That means me for rescuing you, Aunt
Jane.</p>

<p>(<i>Kitty fastens the top of a tin can to Betty’s
blouse.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Kitty.</i> The Carnegie medal for heroism, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> But also for kindly deeds.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Those chops will be stone cold.</p>

<p><i>Miss Pickett.</i> To finish my speech you are kindly
helping me make. I believe that campers also stand
for kindly deeds, so I wish you to remember me by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
one. (<i>Turns to Lucille.</i>) Lucille, my dear, with
Miss Morgan’s permission you may spend the remainder
of the summer here, and I will send at once
for suitable clothes for you.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Three cheers for Aunt Jane.</p>

<p>(<i>Campers give Wohelo call.</i>)</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THIS play was produced professionally
for several seasons under another title,
and is now released for amateur production
without royalty and without restrictions
of any kind. The scenery and costumes
are simple. Time, about two hours. A
young society girl plays an important part
in overthrowing a corrupt political boss
and brings about the election of her
fiance. The race for the hand of a
wealthy widow by rival suitors furnishes
the comedy. A pretty story is unfolded,
but without actual love-making or any
scenes objectionable to the amateur.
Recommended for high schools and dramatic
clubs.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
